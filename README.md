# Pokegex
A simple pokemon retriever using APIs and regex

This work was a one-day assignment @ emlyon, was intended as a beginners course on APIs but I decided to make it more interesting and use some more "complex" code such as some regex, hence the lack of a decent and clear UI.

Type in the name in all lowercase of a pokemon and retrieve him and a few more infos !
